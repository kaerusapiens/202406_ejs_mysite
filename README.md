# What is EJS?

EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. 

1. JavaScript Logic in HTML:
EJS allows you to embed JavaScript code directly within your HTML. This makes it easy to insert dynamic data into your web pages.

2. Control Structures:
You can use standard JavaScript control structures (like if-else conditions and loops) within your EJS templates.

3. Partial Templates:
EJS supports including partial templates, allowing you to break down your HTML into reusable components.

4. Template Inheritance:
With EJS, you can create layouts that other templates can extend, helping you maintain consistent structure across multiple pages.
